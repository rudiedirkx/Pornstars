<b>Overall Objective</b><br>
<br>
Gaining a score that will meet the standards of the top or even better: be the top!<br>
You do this by building anything for points. Ships, waves and even resources gather points.<br>
If you are a=<?=$g_prefs->military_scorelimit?> times bigger than your target, you cannot attack it. You can attack anyone bigger than you though.<br>
If a=0, you can attack anyone you want, as long as the planet is not under protection or blocked.<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Quickguide</b><br>
<br>
<i>1st</i><br>
Activate your roids! A roid makes either Crystal or Metal! Choose careful!<br>
<br>
<i>2nd</i><br>
Start one Research and one Construction. Again: Choose careful!<br>
<br>
<i>3rd</i><br>
&#183;&#183;&#183; dont forget to click on "READY 2 PLAY" or your ticks wont start!! &#183;&#183;&#183;<br>
If the ticks have already started, you must always be Constructing and Researching.<br>
Study the TechTree to get the right order of researching and constructing.<br>
<br>
**<br>
The WAVES section is very very important in this game, certainly in the early stages. Note that all waves and scans cost both Crystal and Energy. You are going to need alot of C and E to scan for a lot of Asteroids!<br>
Energy is gained by growing Creons in the Energy Area.<br>
Creons are highly radioactive and very dangerous! Therefore, they're sprayed with some bad ass stuff! This unfortunately makes your Creons decrease with 0.06% per tick... Make sure you keep growing those Creons!<br>
**<br>
<br>
<i>4th and on</i><br>
Research and Construct the right things in order to make many Asteroids and DO activate them in the RESOURCES area!<br>
Activating Asteroids costs Metal, only the first was free. Getting more Asteroids, each roid will be more expensive to activate.<br>
Make many Asteroids. Upto 300 if you like. If you have a LOT of resources you dont use, you can build some ships to protect all your Asteroids. You can also build ships to attack people already! You can also build no ships and invest all your resources in Asteroids!<br>
<br>
**<br>
Note that you cant attack nor be attacked the first 200 ticks of your existance! The length of a tick and the time remaining untill a new one is always present in the upper right corner of every section.<br>
